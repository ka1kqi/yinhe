    add cURL as dependency/ required library

structure:
    enum two types of orders -> goodToCancel / fillToKill
    enum sides -> BUY / SELL
    OrderID to search up order, uint64_t maybe or uuid but maybe slow

    levelinfo structure stores price and a quantity, essentially a price and how many people are willing to buy at price

    store bids and asks as vectors of levelinfo

    store bids and asks in struct or class

    order class:
        takes a type of order (side), orderid to distinguish order, price, and quantity
        also stores the initial and remaining quantity so we know when it is filled
        methods: Fill to fill order. 

    Orderpointer
        shared pointer to an order obj.

    Trade info struct :
        stores orderid, price and quantity

    Trade class:
        stores tradeinfo of bid and ask

    Orderbook class:
        store bids and asks as map<price, list of orderpointers> each
            this way we can look up orders that match the key price
        check if an order can be matched parameters (side, price). Doesn't need to take order object, we only need  
            a check on whether we can match it or not.
